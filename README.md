# product_categorization
  -- categorize products based on meta info and description/details

 -- install the required libraries from requirements.txt

 -- To run any file, go to terminal and type python "filename"
   eg., python train.py initializes the training pipeline

 -- make sure to change the file names and path

 -- while predicting use the preprocessed csv(not the json)

 -- train.py is the best model currently. can also try xgboost_tfidf or rf_tfidf, if a quicker model is needed. but will have relatively low accuracy
